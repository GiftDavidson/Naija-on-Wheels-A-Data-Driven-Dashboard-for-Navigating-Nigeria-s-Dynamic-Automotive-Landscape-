# Naija-on-Wheels-A-Data-Driven-Dashboard-for-Navigating-Nigeria-s-Dynamic-Automotive-Landscape-

# Description:

This project presents a comprehensive analytical dashboard that dissects the dynamic and vibrant Nigerian used car market. Sourced from real-world data from Car45.com, a leading automotive marketplace, this analysis transforms raw data into a clear, visual story of what drives Nigeria's vehicle preferences.

The dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of the market's core metrics, revealing that the average vehicle is priced at ₦21 Million, has a mileage of 14,000 km, and boasts a performance spec of 132 Horsepower from a 2.2L engine. Beyond these numbers, the analysis delves into the heart of consumer behavior, identifying Toyota as the dominant and most trusted brand, followed by a diverse mix of other manufacturers.

Key insights into driver preferences are uncovered, showing a nearly balanced split between Automatic and Manual transmissions, reflecting the varied needs of Nigerian drivers. Furthermore, the project answers the critical stylistic question of "which color wins?" by ranking the most popular vehicle colors, with practical shades like White, Black, and Silver leading the preference, crucial for understanding resale value and aesthetic trends.

This dashboard serves as an essential tool for potential car buyers, sellers, investors, and market analysts, offering data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions, identify market opportunities, and understand the complex fabric of Nigeria's automotive ecosystem.

What is the prevailing preference between automatic and manual transmissions?

Which car colors are most favored in the market?

How can these insights guide a strategic purchase or sale?

# Visuals Used
Your dashboard effectively employs a combination of visualizations to present the data:

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Cards: Located at the top, these provide a clear, at-a-glance summary of the average vehicle's vital statistics: Price (₦21M), Mileage (14K km), Horsepower (132 hp), and Engine Size (2.2k).

Bar Chart (Top 10 Car Models): This visualization ranks the most popular car brands, clearly showing Toyota as the dominant leader, followed by other brands like SsangYong, GMC, etc., highlighting market brand loyalty.

Pie Chart (Transmission Type): A classic pie chart breaks down the proportion of vehicles with Automatic (18%) vs. Manual (22%) transmissions, revealing a nearly balanced market preference with a slight lean towards manual gearboxes.

Stacked bar Chart (Car Colors): The "which color wins?" section is visualized ( stacked bar chart) to display the popularity of different car colors, with White, Black, and Silver typically leading in such markets due to practicality and resale value.

# Key Features 
Consolidated Market Overview: The KPIs provide a immediate snapshot of the market's core offering.

Brand Performance Tracking: Identifies market leaders and niche players.

# Summary
This project successfully transforms raw data from Car45.com and inspiration from freeborn Dashboard into an insightful and actionable dashboard titled "Naija on Wheels." It provides a comprehensive overview of the Nigerian automotive sector, quantifying the average vehicle's cost and specifications while diving deeper into the qualitative aspects of consumer choice. The visualization of top brands, transmission types, and color preferences paints a clear picture of what the market demands and offers, serving as a valuable resource for anyone involved in this vibrant economic space.

# Conclusion
The analysis conclusively reveals a robust and defined market structure. Toyota emerges as the undisputed leader in brand preference, indicating a high trust in reliability and parts availability. The average car in Nigeria is priced around ₦21 million, with a relatively low average mileage of 14,000 km, suggesting a market with fairly new or well-maintained used vehicles. The near-even split between automatic and manual transmissions points to a diverse driver base with varying preferences.

Ultimately, this dashboard is more than just charts and numbers; it's a strategic compass. For a buyer, it highlights which brands and colors hold their value. For a seller, it indicates how to price a vehicle competitively. By leveraging these data-driven insights, stakeholders can navigate the Nigerian car market with greater confidence and precision, moving beyond guesswork to informed, strategic decision-making.
